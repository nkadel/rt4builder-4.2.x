Some random notes on rt4 on Fedora:


Finalizing the installation
===========================

The default configuration is set up for a mysql based rt4 system. 
It requires additional steps to be performed by the sysadmin to be 
fully functional. 

If you have never set up rt4 before, proceed as follows:
1. Log-in to the server as root

2. Install a mysql server:
# yum install mysql-server

3. Startup the mysql server:
# /sbin/service mysqld start

4. Set up the mysql server.
If not already done, at minimum, you will want to set up a mysql root 
password:
# mysqladmin -u root password <mysql-root-password>

5. Edit /etc/rt4/RT_SiteConfig.pm to meet your demands.
You will want to compare RT_SiteConfig.pm against RT_Config.pm and
add customized versions of those settings from RT_Config.pm to 
RT_SiteConfig.pm.

In particular, you probably will want to add customized versions of
those setting containing "example.com" to your RT_SiteConfig.pm.

6. Initialize rt4's mysql database:
# /usr/sbin/rt-setup-database --action init \
  --dba root \
  --dba-password <mysql-root-password>

7. Start/restart apache/httpd:
# /sbin/service httpd start
rsp.
# /sbin/service httpd restart

8. Try to log in:
At this point, you should be able to login into rt4 on your rt4-host via
its web interface as rt4-administrator (root), from an arbitrary host with
http:-access to your rt4-host:
e.g.:
<your-favorite-browser> http://<rt4-host>/rt4

You should be greeted with a login window. Login with 
Username: root, Password: password.

The next step should be to change your rt4's "root" account's password,
otherwise anybody with web access to your site will be able to abuse 
your site.

Afterwards, you should be ready to create user accounts, configure 
the mail-interface etc.
